# Project contract

## Product binding — MANEF Architecture

This starter is now bound to the MANEF Architecture product. The authoritative PRD is `docs/PRD.md`. Production origin is `https://diagram.manef.dev`; Svelte 5 is the reference renderer, while `slices/architecture-inventory/` owns the framework-neutral TypeScript contract reusable from SvelteKit and Next.js. A node may contain a child diagram of that same contract, at most three levels deep. The bundled public graph stays nine services and eight edges; only `diagram.manef.dev` ships a component diagram, and that diagram describes this product. Convex snapshots still store the flat graph. Convex Cloud is optional persistence. Production currently uses the Vercel adapter; the Node adapter supports Dokploy. Private infrastructure inventory must never be copied into the bundled public seed.

This is the maintained map of shared invariants and their authoritative files. Read it
at the start of each session. It records the current template, not a hypothetical client
application. Detailed implementation guidance lives in [architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Authentication provider boundary

MANEF targets the existing WorkOS project for its shared production identity. The WorkOS adapter and
rollout requirements are documented in [WorkOS sign-in](docs/workos-login.md). Direct
Google OIDC remains a compatibility opt-in; no Google-owned data is silently migrated
by email. Private ownership uses the verified issuer and subject. Hosted login, backend
JWT configuration, and real production consent are separate acceptance gates.

## Current baseline

- One SvelteKit app uses Svelte 5 Runes and Bun. `bun.lock` is the only package lockfile.
- Convex is the default backend; its frontend connection is optional. A clean clone
  starts without credentials. Status metadata is public; notes require backend ownership checks.
- Feature UI lives in root `slices/<slug>/`; cross-slice imports use `$features/<slug>`
  barrels. Routes are thin framework adapters; the existing app page family uses one registry.
- Payments and email are disabled transport building blocks, preferring DOKU and Resend
  when selected. Google auth/private notes, BYOK AI and remote MCP are implemented opt-ins. GCP service
  adapters and Cloudflare Workers remain recipes; Node hosting is implemented.
- Workspace and settings examples are local UI state. They provide no identity, ownership
  or tenancy guarantee. Google subjects own private notes. Payment/email lifecycle acceptance
  remains product work; provider credentials and product deployment need tenant-specific setup.

| Release identity                    | `version.json`; synchronize with `bun run version:bump`                 |

| Feature definitions and navigation  | Slice definitions and `slices/app-shell/registry.ts`                    |
| Theme and reusable UI               | `src/routes/layout.css`, `src/lib/components/`                          |
| Assets and generation inputs        | `assets.config.ts`; outputs follow [assets.md](docs/assets.md)          |
| Backend schema and API              | `src/convex/`; `_generated/` is CLI-produced and committed              |
| Private integration selection       | `src/lib/server/integrations/config.ts`                                 |
| Authentication                      | `src/lib/server/auth/`, `src/convex/auth.config.ts`                     |
| AI/MCP selection and request access | `src/lib/server/ai/`, `src/lib/server/mcp/`, `src/lib/server/access.ts` |
| Environment requirements            | `.env.example`, [consumer matrix](docs/environment.md)                  |

Do not duplicate version pins, menus, brand constants or provider checks in other files.
Ordinary feature-local copy stays local; sharing configuration does not require turning
every value into a global option. Indexing needs `PUBLIC_SEO_INDEXABLE=true` and an
explicit origin; preview sites and demo app routes remain noindex. Metadata and crawler
documents share the SEO settings in `src/lib/config/metadata.ts`.

## Trust and runtime boundaries

Private reads, writes and actions authenticate and authorize ownership/tenant membership
on the backend. Validate arguments, results and business limits; bound growing reads.
Public metadata is an explicit exception, never a private-feature auth pattern.

Public config, assets, prompts and browser data contain no secrets. Immutable shared
configuration is allowed; mutable user/session state shared across server requests is not.
The bounded burst limiter is a documented exception for hashed counters only, not a session
or credential store; multi-instance deployments need an external rate limit.
SvelteKit server modules and Convex actions use the environment of their executing runtime.
Convex imports cannot depend on SvelteKit aliases or environment modules. BYOK keys and
chat history stay in current request/tab memory. Tool output is untrusted data; MCP calls
require configured endpoint/tool allowlists and explicit review, never automatic model execution. See the focused
[Svelte](docs/svelte-best-practices.md) and [Convex](docs/convex-best-practices.md) rules.

## Adapting this contract to a product

The product PRD is `docs/PRD.md`; deployment ownership and live acceptance evidence must stay revision-specific. When creating a
product, add `docs/PRD.md` from [the template](docs/prd-template.md), then replace this
paragraph with its link and current scope. Record the product owner, deployment/operations
owner, enabled capabilities and acceptance evidence there; never invent names or credentials.
Keep product identity in its code config and runtime values in their environment.

## Maintenance and proof

Update this contract in the same change that moves an authoritative file, changes a
shared boundary/default, activates a capability or changes its ownership model. Update
the affected detailed guide too. Routine component edits need no contract rewrite.

Checks live in `package.json` and [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md); evidence belongs to the
actual revision and environment tested. Keep transient progress in the task/PRD, not
as a second status ledger here. Use [agent-workflow.md](docs/agent-workflow.md) to resume
from current files and preserve clear, compact handoffs.
