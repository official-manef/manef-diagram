# MANEF Context Graph

`diagram.manef.dev` is both an interactive diagram editor and a portable context-map surface for agents.

## Context graph rather than only a note graph

The graph stores explicit relationships, input/output ports, status, searchable inventory references, and namespaced facets. An agent can request a bounded view and receive a navigable URL instead of only a screenshot or local vault reference.

## Facet convention

Use namespaced tags for machine-readable context:

- `project:<slug>` — project or workstream
- `platform:<slug>` — runtime, provider, or client surface
- `agent:<slug>` — agent responsibility or provenance
- `kind:<slug>` — product, service, decision, memory, person, document, backend, deployment, etc.
- `source:<slug>` — GitHub, MSO, Gmail, Notion, manual, etc.

Selections are OR-ed inside one namespace and AND-ed across namespaces.

## Navigable views

The `/app` route is canonical. `/diagram` redirects to `/app` and preserves the query string. `/app` accepts repeated `tag` and `seed` parameters plus `q`, `mode=flow|graph`, `trace=direct|component`, `focus=1`, and optional `graph=<JSON>` for bounded portable graphs.

The UI can copy the current edited graph plus active view state as a portable URL.

## MCP surface

The MCP endpoint is `/api/mcp/server`. Existing read-only graph tools remain available. Context-graph tools add faceted query and navigable URL generation. Portable graph creation is stateless: the graph is encoded into the URL and validated by the same graph contract before rendering.

Portable links contain the graph in their query string. Share only content intended for every recipient; links can appear in browser history and host logs. Invalid or oversized incoming graphs show the default graph with a recoverable error. These links do not save personal snapshots to Convex.

Owner-scoped Convex snapshots are a separate optional backend capability. Agent-write persistence still needs a dedicated server-side authorization boundary with provenance and access control rather than exposing Convex mutations directly to arbitrary clients.
